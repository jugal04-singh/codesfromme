                    <h2>great warrior of bharat </h2>
                    <p>Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which
                        Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.
                        His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two
                        stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was
                        Maharani Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia. Their eldest son was Amar Singh I. He belonged to the
                        Royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572,
                        Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred
                        Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles
                        prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line
                        of the Sisodia Rajputs. He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi.
                        Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of
                        Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.</p>

                    <h2>Battle of Haldighati</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of
                            Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom in the Aravalli
                            range was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor Akbar was intent on
                            securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king
                            (Maharana) in 1572,
                            Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh I of Amer, entreating him to
                            become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused to personally
                            submit to Akbar and
                            several attempts to diplomatically settle the issue failed, war became inevitable.

                            The forces of Pratap Singh and Mughal and Rajput general Man Singh met on 18 June 1576
                            beyond a narrow mountain pass at
                            Haldighati near Gogunda, modern day Rajsamand in Rajasthan. This came to be known as the
                            Battle of Haldighati. Pratap Singh
                            fielded a force of around 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. Man Singh commanded an army
                            numbering around 10,000 men.
                            After a fierce battle lasting more than three hours, Pratap found himself wounded and the
                            day lost. He managed to retreat to the hills
                            and lived to fight another day. The Mughals were victorious and inflicted significant
                            casualties among the forces of Mewar but failed
                            to capture Maharana Pratap.

                            Haldighati was a futile victory for the Mughals, as they were unable to kill or capture
                            Pratap, or any of his close family members in Udaipur.
                            While the sources also claim that Pratap was able to make a successful escape, Man Singh
                            managed to conquer Gogunda within a week after Haldighati then
                            ended his campaign. Subsequently, Akbar himself led a sustained campaign against the Rana in
                            September 1576, and soon, Gogunda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh were
                            all under Mughal control.
